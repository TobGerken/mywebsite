## The Project

::: {.grid}

:::{.g-col-4}
[Flash droughts](https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-flash-drought-an-earth-scientist-explains-194141) are rapidly intensifying droughts that develop over the course of a few days to weeks. They can have devastating consequences for agriculture and water resources. 

Ongoing and future climate change, [will likely increase the risk of flash drought](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00826-1). 

The reason for the rapid drought development during flash drought is poorly understood, but we think [that feedbacks between the land-surface and atmosphere](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28752-4) are at least partially to blame.

The National Science Foundation has recently funded a [research project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303457&HistoricalAwards=false) in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison to help uncovering the role of land-atmosphere feedbacks on drought development and intensification; **and you can be part of this research!**
